Introduction

We consume news through several mediums throughout the day in our daily routine, but sometimes it becomes difficult to decide which one is fake and which one is authentic.

Do you trust all the news you consume from online media?

Every news that we consume is not real. If you listen to fake news it means you are collecting the wrong information from the world which can affect society because a personâ€™s views or thoughts can change after consuming fake news which the user perceives to be true.
Since all the news we encounter in our day-to-day life is not authentic, how do we categorize if the news is fake or real?
In this Project, we will focus on text-based news and try to build a model that will help us to identify if a piece of given news is fake or real.

Tools and Technologies used:
Google Colab, Pandas, Numpy, Regular expression (RE),NLTK, SK-Learn, Machine Learning Algorithm(Logistic Regression)
